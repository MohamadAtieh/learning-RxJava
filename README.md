# learning-RxJava
**A set of RxJava sources &amp; examples from all around the web, implemented again.**

------------------
Open [the .iml file](/GrokkingRxJava/GrokkingRxJava.iml) to load the project. I'm using Intellij Idea Community Version with Java 8.

*Notice*: If you ran into errors for the @Override notations and unsupported Lambdas, make sure to leave the target SDK empty in **File -> Settings -> Compiler (use search bar)**. Also, head to the .iml used to import the project, modify the compontent's attribute - LANGUAGE_LEVEL - to **JDK_1_8**.

Re-Build the project (Build -> Rebuild Project).

	related operations which return an Observable. This repo replaces all these calls
	with loops and basic object manipulation* - Ends on example 11
